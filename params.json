[/note]\r\n\r\nIf you have publishing rights (aka the blog owner/author), then the note will be displayed in a div with a private-note class, so you can use it to give a specific style to your notes.  The text won't show at all for normal visitors.\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"private-note\"> This is a personal note that only admins can see! </div>\r\n\r\nThanks to @catswhocode for his post which IS this plugin he shared on his post at http://www.wprecipes.com/add-private-notes-to-your-wordpress-blog-posts","tagline":"Private Notes Plugin for WordPress","google":"UA-32066922-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
