== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would this be useful? =

Sometimes when writing a post, you may collect additional resources to build the post.  Such as reference URLs, thoughts, additional topics, forum threads to post in, etc.  With this you can keep that info with the post, but it remains hidden to users.

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =

Your notes will not be lost, but they will be publicly visible and seen the same as they're in your post, example: [note] my notes [/note]
