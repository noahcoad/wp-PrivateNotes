Private Notes Addin for WordPress

Once installed in WordPress, simply add the following shortcode in your posts:

[note]
This is a personal note that only admins can see!
[/note]

Note that the note will be displayed in a div with a note class, so you can use it to give a specific style to your notes!

  <div class="note">
  </div>
