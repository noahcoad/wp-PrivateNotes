Private Notes Addin for WordPress

Once installed in WordPress, simply add the following shortcode in your posts:
[note]
This is a personal note that only admins can see!
[/note]

Note that the note will be displayed with a <div class="note"></div> tags, so you can use it to give a specific style to your notes!
