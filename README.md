Private Notes Plugin for WordPress

Once installed in WordPress, simply add the following shortcode in your posts:

    [note] This is a personal note that only admins can see! [/note]

If you have publishing rights (aka the blog owner/author), then the note will be displayed in a div with a note class, so you can use it to give a specific style to your notes.  The text won't render at all for normal visitors.

    <div class="note"> This is a personal note that only admins can see! </div>
