Private Notes Plugin for WordPress

Site URL: http://noahcoad.github.com/wp-PrivateNotes/

To install put the private-notes.zip file in the wp-content/plugins directory or upload it via the Plugins page.

Once installed in WordPress, simply add the following shortcode in your posts:

    [note] This is a personal note that only admins can see! [/note]

If you have publishing rights (aka the blog owner/author), then the note will be displayed in a div with a private-note class, so you can use it to give a specific style to your notes.  The text won't render at all for normal visitors.

    <div class="private-note"> This is a personal note that only admins can see! </div>
